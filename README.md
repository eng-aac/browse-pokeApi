### Make up the initial view of the app. In it, you can search, through an input to your Pokemons. A named validated input; (shows a label with the validation of the text entered) you can manage it using 3 buttons: Choose You, Don't Catch and Come Back. With the first you carry out the submit event, the second clears said input with its label and the third clears the cards as well. Said request to the backend will result in a card of the selected Pokemon; with the Order, Name, Base Expperience, Type and image data.
